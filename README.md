# Skuddbot
Welcome to Skuddbot, the revolutionary (and fun) Discord bot!

## Skudd-who?
Skuddbot. Try saying it like Skuddbot. See, not that hard, right? You're learning quick. Great!  
Skuddbot is a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot written in Java with the [Discord4J library](https://github.com/austinv11/Discord4J) for the [Discord API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro).

## So... What does it do?
Currently not much. But don't be disappointed!  
Skuddbot is still in (as I like to call it) `very-early-probally-wont-work-alpha`, which means I'm still building Skuddbot. I have planned the following features:

- **XP System**
- Item System
- Currency
- **Cleverbot**
- *Dank Memes*
- **Welcome/Goodbye Messages**
- Customizeable Command System
- **Database saving**
- *Twitch Chat tracking* (2/3 phases complete)
- **Multi-Server capabilities.**

> Items marked in **bold** are ready, *italics* are currently under developement, normal text is planned (but not confirmed).

## So, why did you decide to make Skuddbot? Some bots can do those things already.
Exactly, and that's the point.  
We needed multiple bots to achieve those things. So we're making a all-in-one solution.

## Can I run Skuddbot too?
At the moment: No, but you can join the Closed Alpha and use the version that is hosted by me (and officially supported), check out [the manual](https://goo.gl/oWoyG2) for more information on that! 
No worries, Skuddbot is completely capable of handling multiple servers and making sure the data is separated.

If you are super smart and can figure out how to obtain your own build, and make sure it actually can run, you're free to do that, **BUT** don't expect any support.
