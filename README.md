# Skuddbot
Welcome to Skuddbot, the revolutionary (and fun) Discord bot!

## Skudd-who?
Skuddbot. Try saying it like Skuddbot. See, not that hard, right? You're learning quick. Great!  
Skuddbot is a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot written in Java with the [Discord4J library](https://github.com/austinv11/Discord4J) for the [Discord API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro).

## So... What does it do?
Currently not much. But don't be dissapointed!  
Skuddbot is still in (as I like to call it) `very-early-probally-wont-work-alpha`, which means I'm still building Skuddbot. I have planned the following features:

- **XP System**
- Item System
- Currency
- **Cleverbot**
- *Dank Memes*
- **Welcome/Goodbye Messages**
- Customizeable Command System
- **Database saving**
- *Twitch Chat tracking* [(2/3 phases complete)](https://gitlab.com/Cooltimmetje/skuddbot/issues/1)
- **Multi-Server capabilities.**

> Items marked in **bold** are ready, *italics* are currently under developement, normal text is planned (but not confirmed).

## So, why did you decide to make Skuddbot? Some bots can do those things already.
Exactly, and that's the point.  
We needed multiple bots to achieve those things. So we're making a all-in-one solution.

## Can I run Skuddbot too?
Yeah, but I'm not gonna give instructions on that, other than there are Build Artifacts available [here](https://gitlab.com/Cooltimmetje/skuddbot/pipelines).
You can also join the Closed Alpha, check out [the manual](https://goo.gl/oWoyG2) for more information on that!
