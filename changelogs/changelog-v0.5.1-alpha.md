# The "it needed an update" update. (v0.5.1-ALPHA)

This update mostly refactors the entire bot to v3 of Discord4J, there's absolutely no guarantee it'll work.  
I will be doing this in a "run and pray" fashion. Meaning I will keep refactoring till it compiles and runs, and then we will see what systems work, and which don't. Then I will fix those.  
I am also taking this refactor opportunity to remove some old and obsolete systems. (see changelog)  
After this update some commands and systems will receive a rewrite so it comes more in line with the rest of the bot. (see TODO comments in the code, there will be milestones for this later)

I thank you for your patience while we get the bot back to a stable state.
