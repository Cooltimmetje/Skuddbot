# v0.4.42-ALPHA

## Added
- Winstreaks for `!challenge`.
  - You gain more XP the bigger your streak is. (Thanks for the idea Lockstar)
    - Bonus XP is calculated with this formula: `bonusXP = (winStreak - 1) * 25`.
- `!puppy`
- `!ffa`
  - Free for All fights! - Battle it out with an unlimited* amount of people!
- Stats for `!challenge`
- `!stats`
- `!kitty`
  - I know I have said I would never add this... But shit happens.
- Open challenges!
  - Start one by typing `!challenge -open`


## Improved
- Challenge now properly seperates between servers.
  - Cooldowns are now per server.
  - You can now have one outstanding challenge per server.
- Outstanding and ongoing challenges now cause the involved users to always punch/hug their competitor.

#### Notes
\*They aren't unlimited, but you know what I mean.
