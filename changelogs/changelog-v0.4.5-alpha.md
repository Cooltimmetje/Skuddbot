## Changed
- `!ffa`'s now must have 3 users before they can be started.
- Guild owners and users with the admin role can now force start `!ffa`'s, by adding the :eyes: emoji to the message.
  - By using this reaction they can also bypass the 3 user requirement, this is then lowered to 2.

- Optimization for `!hug` and `!punch`.


## Backend changes
